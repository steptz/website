* Java and Apache NetBeans: This was the first environment that I used to learn coding in high school. I have not used Java in a few years. Most knowledge is in geometric formulas and basic object-oriented programming.
* LaTeX and Overleaf: I have used this for writing papers that includes tables, images, bibliographies, and more.
* Matlab: Used this environment for a little bit. Most knowledge is in creating functions and analyzing matrices.
* NetLogo: Basic knowledge in building models/simulations.
* Python and Jupyter Notebook: Recently started using python. Most knowledge is in network analysis, creating basic functions, and SQL queries.
* R and RStudio: This is the environment that I have the most knowledge in. I am a teacherâ€™s assistant that teaches this language to students. Most knowledge is in data analysis, creating visualizations, and basic website construction.
* SQLite and DB Browser for SQLite: Most knowledge is in queries for different databases.
* Fortran and SimplyFortran: Most knowledge is in all things scientific computing.
