Hi! My name is Zachary Stept. I am a Computational and Data Science major in his fourth term (sophomore year) at George Mason University. 

### Work Environments

* Java: This was the first environment that I used to learn coding in high school. I have not used Java in a few years. Most knowledge is on geometric formulas and basic object-oriented programming.
* Python: Recently started using python. Most knowledge is in network analysis and creating basic functions.
* R/RStudio: This is the environment that I have the most knowledge in. I am a teacherâ€™s assistant that teaches this language to students. Most knowledge is in data analysis, creating visuals, and basic website construction.
* NetLogo: Recently started using NetLogo, but not enough knowledge to create a new model/simulation.
* Matlab: Used this environment for a little bit. Most knowledge is in creating functions and analyzing matrices.
