Hi! My name is Zachary Stept. I am a Computational and Data Science major in my third year at George Mason University. I am also a CDS STAR (Teacher's Assistant) for CDS 101 which is a class that introduces data analysis through the use of R. I have been introducing students to the program as a CDS STAR for four semesters.

### Programming Languages and IDEs

* Java and Apache NetBeans: This was the first environment that I used to learn coding in high school. I have not used Java in a few years. Most knowledge is on geometric formulas and basic object-oriented programming.
* LaTeX and Overleaf: I have used this for writing papers that includes tables, images, bibliographies, and more.
* Matlab: Used this environment for a little bit. Most knowledge is in creating functions and analyzing matrices.
* NetLogo: Recently started using NetLogo, but not enough knowledge to create a new model/simulation.
* Python and Jupyter Notebook: Recently started using python. Most knowledge is in network analysis, creating basic functions, and SQL queries.
* R and RStudio: This is the environment that I have the most knowledge in. I am a teacherâ€™s assistant that teaches this language to students. Most knowledge is in data analysis, creating visualizations, and basic website construction.
* SQLite and DB Browser for SQLite: Most knowledge is in queries for different databases.
