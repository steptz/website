Hi! My name is Zachary Stept. I am a recent graduate of George Mason University in Farifax, Virgina where I earned a Bachelors of Science in Computational and Data Science. I was a CDS STAR (Teaching Assistant) for CDS 101 which introduces students to data analysis and data science through the use of R for six semeseters, as well as CDS 201 which introduces students to computational social science through the use of NetLogo for one semester.

I am currently seeking information for full-time employment or more connections. My professional contact information can be found below in the Contact section and my resume can be found by using the Resume tab above.

### Programming Languages

* Java: This was the first language and environment that I used to learn coding in high school. I have not used Java in a few years. Most knowledge is in geometric formulas and basic object-oriented programming.

* Matlab: Used this language for a little bit. Most knowledge is in creating functions and analyzing matrices.

* R: This is the language that I have the most knowledge in. I was a teaching assistant that taught this language to students. Most knowledge is in data analysis, creating visualizations, and basic website construction.
* SQLite: Most knowledge is in queries for different databases.
* Fortran: Most knowledge is in all things scientific computing.
* SAS: Most knowledge is in data analysis and visualizations.
