Hi! My name is Zachary Stept. I am a Computational and Data Science major in my fourth year at George Mason University. I am also a CDS STAR (Teaching Assistant) for CDS 101 which introduces students to data analysis and data science through the use of R, as well as CDS 201 which introduces students to computational social science through the use of NetLogo. I have been assisting students with CDS 101 for five semesters and have been assisting students with CDS 201 for one semester.

I am currently seeking information for full-time employment once I graduate from George Mason University in May 2023. My professional contact information can be found below in the Contact section and my resume can be found by using the Resume tab above.

### Programming Languages

* Java: This was the first language and environment that I used to learn coding in high school. I have not used Java in a few years. Most knowledge is in geometric formulas and basic object-oriented programming.
