This [README.md](https://github.com/steptz/mason-cds-assignments-directory) file is a directory of all assignments that I have completed during my time at George Mason. Each link leads to the assignments repository.  

Note: This is an ongoing project and will be continuosly updated until my graduation (May 2023).
